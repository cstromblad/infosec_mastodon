# Automatically updated Mastodon INFOSEC CSV file
This repository contains a CSV-file which is automatically updated every 24 hours. The original source is: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t13k5_cNhP9_TgoUmqDZk2ROkWkF6Bg3O5269vKIqWw/view maintained by Lukasz Olejnik, @lukOlejnik, @LukaszOlejnik@mastodon.social.

I've made some effort keeping the data "clean". There is some level of variation on the input (what's in the sheets-document), and I've tried to make it somewhat clean.
# Todo
- Upload the ugly Python script performing the actual processing in case someone is interested in performing their own processing and creation of an importable CSV-file.
